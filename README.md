A [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) Plugin to create a Mac OSX .app application and dmg based on the project.

Forked from https://github.com/crotwell/gradle-macappbundle at version 2.3.0. 

We needed to make some changes to get it working with Gradle 6+ and Java 11+.

This project is required for building Raven. The output JAR needs to be installed in your local Maven repository.

To do this, you should just need to clone this repository, and run:

```gradle publishToMavenLocal```

***Note I am no longer able to actively develop this project.***

I will consider pull requests, but I believe that the Java world has changed significantly over the past several years, and this plugin may no longer be the recommended way to package a Java app for OSX.

Available at [plugins.gradle.org](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/edu.sc.seis.macAppBundle).

**Version 2.3.0 released 27 November 2018.**

Now available via the Gradle Plugin Portal. Please see:
http://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/edu.sc.seis.macAppBundle

To add to a gradle project, add this to build.gradle and run **gradle createApp** or **gradle createDmg**. The first should work on most systems, the second will only work on Mac OSX as it uses hdiutils which is a Mac-only application. Also see the [Wiki](https://github.com/crotwell/gradle-macappbundle/wiki/Intro) for more information.

For gradle 2.1 or later:
```
plugins {
  id "edu.sc.seis.macAppBundle" version "2.3.0"
}
```
